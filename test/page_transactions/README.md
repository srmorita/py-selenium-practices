By selecting this code for validation, the [Guará](https://github.com/douglasdcm/guara/blob/main/README.md) team aims to showcase that the framework is capable of handling common UI interactions, providing reusable assertions, and ensuring tests are easy to maintain and extend. The framework's focus on transactions (operations on pages) ensures that the code remains modular and scalable for larger test suites.

Explanation of Code and Its Purpose
1. Login Transaction (Class Login):

    This class encapsulates the logic for logging into the website.
    It inherits from AbstractTransaction, and its do method performs the login by interacting with the webpage elements like username, password fields, and the submit button.
    It also checks for the presence of the logout button to determine if the login was successful. If the button is present, it returns a success message; otherwise, it returns a failure message.

2. Assertion (Class VerifyLoginSuccess):

    This class implements the IAssertion interface from Guará to verify the result of the login transaction.
    It checks whether the result returned by the Login transaction matches the expected value (i.e., "Login successful").

3. Application Usage:

    The Application class orchestrates the flow of executing the transaction and applying assertions.
    app.at(Login, firefox_browser, username="student", password="Password123") executes the Login transaction, passing the necessary parameters.
    app.asserts(VerifyLoginSuccess(), result, "Login successful") applies the assertion strategy, verifying if the login was successful.

Purpose of the Code Selection

The code was selected by the Guará team to validate the framework's capabilities because it showcases the following aspects:

    Separation of Concerns:
        The code demonstrates the Page Transactions Pattern where the operations (login functionality) are encapsulated within a class (Login) and assertions are handled separately in a different class (VerifyLoginSuccess).

    Extensibility:
        By using the AbstractTransaction class for the Login transaction and IAssertion for assertions, the code is easily extendable. New transactions or assertion strategies can be added without modifying the core logic.

    Test Orchestration:
        The use of the Application class illustrates the orchestrated execution of transactions and validations. This is a core capability of the Guará framework, demonstrating how test actions and assertions are smoothly integrated into a single, coherent flow.

    Framework Validation:
        The test is simple and functional but covers key aspects such as form interaction, result validation, and error handling (i.e., verifying the presence of the logout button).
        It validates that the framework can perform interactions with web pages and that assertions can be applied to check the correctness of the operations.

    Maintainability and Readability:
        The code structure is highly readable, with clear separation between actions and assertions. It is an example of how Guará can make test automation code easy to maintain and understand, using natural language-like syntax for assertions.
